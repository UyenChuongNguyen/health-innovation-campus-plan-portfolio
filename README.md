# Health Innovation Campus Project Plan Portfolio

Welcome to the Health Innovation Campus Project Plan Portfolio. This portfolio consolidates all project deliverables as part of a collaborative built environment course project undertaken at the University of Huddersfield.

## Overview

The Health Innovation Campus is a new, sustainable building project located at Dalton Ward, Southgate/Leeds Road, Huddersfield (HD1 1TW). The project is a joint partnership between:
- University of Huddersfield
- 3M Buckley Innovation Centre
- Kirklees Council's Business Kirklees
- Mid Yorkshire Teaching NHS Trust
- Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust  
‚Ä¶and other local and regional health and well-being partners.

Designed to meet WELL building standards, this seven-storey facility (approx. 2000 m¬≤) integrates modern educational and treatment facilities with innovative construction methods and sustainable materials.

The aim of the Health Innovation Campus project is to raise awareness for health and well-being through a state-of-the-art educational and treatment facility. The building leverages sustainable design and material choices including:
- Concrete foundation
- Cross-laminated timber (CLT) structure
- York stone and corten metal panels for the facade
- Green living wall for roof finish

The project involves multiple phases‚Äîincluding pre-construction, main construction, and post-construction activities‚Äîwith detailed planning for safety, logistics, and quality management.

## Key Deliverables

- **Sustainable Design:** Utilizes sustainable materials such as cross-laminated timber (CLT), York stone, corten metal panels, and green living walls.
